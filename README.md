# LBU-LTI-Tools

A Java Web Application which implements an LTI 1.3 tool. Initially it can only be deployed in Blackboard Learn
because that system provides some extra functionality which means the LTI tool needs to do less work.
Later it will be tested for use with generic LTI 1.3 compliant platforms.
